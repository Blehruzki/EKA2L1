# Hardware rounds

One row per build that went to the phone. The point of this file is so that a
test is never asked for twice: before proposing a run, check whether it is
already here.

**How to use it against me.** If I ask for a hardware run, ask which row it is
not a repeat of. If I state a finding, ask which row established it. If a row's
"settled" column is empty, that round bought nothing and I should say so rather
than let it blur into the next one.

The phone is a **Nokia N95** (Symbian 9.2, S60 3rd FP1). The emulator runs an
RM-409 (5320, 9.3 / FP2). Counts are *traced events* unless stated.

## Builds 1-30 (before the record was kept this way)

Not itemised, and that is itself a finding. These rounds were spent on reboots
that turned out to be **ours** -- two `RFile`s closed with
`RHandleBase::Close`, which closes the file server session. Every theory built
on top of that (a write ceiling, a write rate, extending writes) was fitted to
its shadow. Roughly thirty rounds, and the honest summary is that they taught
us about the instrument rather than the game. Detail is in `PORTING.md` under
"The reboots were the handle".

## Builds 31 onward

| # | The one change | Runs | Result | What it settled |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 31 | `LOG_ZOOM`, filenames on `RFile::Open` | 1 | reboot, 86 events | Located the death precisely for the first time; cost reach |
| 32 | Silent: ~4 writes, box only | 1 | **KERN-EXEC 3**, 128+ | No reboot. First evidence the instrument was the reboot |
| 33 | Box ring 16 -> 64 | 1 | KERN-EXEC 3, 128+ | Phone and emulator match event for event, offset 27 |
| 34 | Box every 8 events, name + exc result | 1 | reboot, 88 | Broke my own write budget. `SetExceptionHandler` returns KErrNone |
| 35 | Ring 128, back to 10 writes | – | superseded | – |
| 36 | **`RFile::Close`** for both bad closes | 3 | KERN-EXEC 3 | Fixed KERN-EXEC 0. The deterministic file-exists switch |
| 37 | `RFile::Open` result thunk | 2+1 | KERN-EXEC 3, **132** | `RFile::Open` returns KErrNone. Reference build, reran later to prove the phone had not changed |
| 38 | Free matching (4 changes at once) | 1 | "64 records" | Nothing. Judged a regression on one run |
| 39 | Heap walk + `CountAllocCells` import | 1 | "64 records" | Nothing |
| 40 | Heap walk able to report | 3 | 128 / short / short | Heap walks clean, **1209 cells** at event 128 |
| 41 | 38 + 40 together | 3 | "64 records" | Nothing |
| 42 | Panic on a failed write | 5 | "64 records", no `G6WR` | Writes are **not** failing. Killed the 512-byte theory |
| 43 | 37 + free matching only | 2 | "64 records" | The import was not the difference |
| 44 | Exact logging over the opening | 1 | **136**, dies in `User::Free(0x7b7cd8)` | 31 frees, all matched. Furthest yet. "64 records" was eight of our own log blocks all along |
| 45 | Flush each freed pointer before the free | 1 | 136, dies freeing `0x7b89a8` | The fatal pointer is now named. Its ring verdict is still missing: the verdict record is written but not flushed |

## What builds 38-43 actually cost

Six rounds, and the table above shows why: builds 38, 39, 41, 42 and 43 all
report "64 records", and **none of them were failing there**. Build 44, with
the same code, reached 136. Sixty-four records is eight `LOG_BLOCK` flushes of
eight, and the tail was sitting unflushed in the buffer the whole time.

Five of those six rounds settled nothing. That is the largest single waste in
this project after the reboots, and it came from reading an instrument's blind
spot as the game's behaviour -- the same mistake, for the fifth time.
| 46 | Flush the ring's verdict, not just the pointer | *pending* | | |

## Where we are

**Furthest: 136 traced events** (builds 44 and 45, same result twice). The run
gets through the whole resource-loading sequence, opens `cwivenc.dat`
successfully, and dies inside a `User::Free`.

**Best round so far: 44.** It was the first to show that "64 records" -- which
five earlier rounds had been scored on -- was our own log block hiding the
tail, and it reached 136 with the free matching working. Everything since is
refinement of what it exposed.

**Runner-up: 36**, the `RFile::Close` fix. It ended a month of reboots and is
the single change that made hardware rounds informative again.

### What is known at the point of failure

| | |
|---|---|
| Heap at event 128 | walks clean, 1209 cells |
| Frees before the fatal one | 31, all matched a live cell, no doubles, no strays |
| `RFile::Open` | returns KErrNone |
| Setup state | identical to the emulator |
| Fatal call | `User::Free(0x7b89a8)` -- build 44 had `0x7b7cd8`, same point, different heap layout |

So the heap is sound, the pointers are sound, and the open succeeds. The one
unmeasured thing is whether the *fatal* pointer is in the ring, and that is one
missing flush away.
